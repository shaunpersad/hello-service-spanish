# hello-service-spanish
The service that provides Spanish words for the "Hello" project.

# Running this example:
1. Download and install Docker for your OS.
2. Make sure you've also got the "hello-ecosystem" repo next to this one: [https://github.com/shaunpersad/hello-ecosystem]
2. In this project root, run `bash scripts/run.sh`
3. Profit!

# Notes
- Any changes you make to the code while the container is running will automatically restart the service, thanks to nodemon.
